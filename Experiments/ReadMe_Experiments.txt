This folder is corresponding to the case studies in the SALAD paper. There are three case studies
(1) SimulationStudy: sparsity of feature function and convergence of algorithm based on simulated dataset
ConceptsProof_Sparsity.m
ConceptsProof_Convergence.m
(2) NumericalStudy: SALAD algorithm with benchmarks on 20 open-source datasets
NumericalStudy_SRTG_Ahmedexamples.m
NumericalStudy_SRTG_ODDS.m
(3) MetalAM: select R area as anomalies with metal AM R7 data used in CDR paper
ConceptsProof_SRTG_CDRMetalAM_55inR.m
(4) PolymerAM: CDR paper: only one anomaly is our interest
