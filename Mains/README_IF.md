# iNNE
Source code of Isolation‐based anomaly detection

These functions implement an Isolation‐based anomaly detection iNNE, proposed by Bandaragoda, Tharindu R., et al. "Isolation‐based anomaly detection using nearest‐neighbor ensembles" Computational Intelligence (2018). https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/coin.12156

Now it is adopted by Bo Shen for online optimization for feedback based anomaly detection
THe codes for isoForest are most important.
